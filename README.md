# Xtern_data_science Conclusions

Review the data set, and draw any conclusions you can find from the data set.
Try to identify the most popular scooter location, demonstrate your findings using data visualization tools,
calculate operation time cost (Operation Time Cost: How long it takes to fully charge all the scooters),
and come up with the most efficient scooter charging strategy. 


# Popular  Location:
  There are various popular locations seeing from the visualized map from the second cell, and two big sections [-0.5<x<0.5, -0.5<y<0.5] and [0.5<x<1.5, 0.5<y<1.5]. 
  
# Operation time cost:
  The program keeps telling me errors and I canot derive a specific answer for this, but my strategy was to have the bus always gets to the closest scooter that is not fully charged.
